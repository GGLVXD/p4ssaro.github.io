# Pássaro Search
Pássaro is a metasearch engine that serves as an universal search box for 35+ search engines and websites, not needing to visit each specific website, instead, just typing its name and be redirected to this website with the search you made in Pássaro's search bar.

Onion only, country restricted and non-english only search engines are not included nor will be, that is why Haystack (Torry has clearnet search by the way, so this doesn't apply to it), Qwant (it isn't even avaliable in my country), Baidu and others aren't included.
